## 7DRL - 2020

My first entry done for the 7DRL, done with Godot and maybe Aseprite
for the graphisms if any.

Started the March 1st 2020 at 10:00 PM.
So technically and ideally, version 1.0 will be out at most the March 8th at 10:00PM!

### March 1st 2020
**Goal for tonight**:
- Having the Godot icon doing grid-based movements!

### March 2nd 2020
**Goal for today**:
- Defining the grid and game size
- Adding the game log
- Player stats and characteristics
- List of actions
  - Key mapping
- Monster list
- Planing the game on paper

**Done**:
- Defining the grid and game size
  - Game screen: 592x800
  - Sprite size: 16x16
  - 3 bottom lines reserved for the game log
  - Some space reserved for the player/game infos
- Adding the game log. Done and working!
- TODO: player stats and characteristcs
- TODO: same for monsters
- TODO: list of actions and key mapping
- TODO: planing more precisely the game

At least that work, it is not bad, but I think I could have done better... And I still need to search how to do the pathfinding with Godot to let the monster reach the player.
