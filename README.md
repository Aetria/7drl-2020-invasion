## 7DRL - 2020

My first entry done for the 7DRL, done with Godot and maybe Aseprite
for the graphisms if any.

Started the March 1st 2020 at 10:00 PM.
So technically and ideally, version 1.0 will be out at most the March 8th at 10:00PM!

### March 1st 2020
**Goal for tonight**: Having the Godot icon doing grid-based movements!
